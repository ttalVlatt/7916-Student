## Question One (copy over from class)

**c)** Make the source of your data (e.g., IPEDS) _italic_

**d)** Change the header title to something appropriate for your final report

**e)** Change the header author to your name

**f)** Change the header date so that it uses the current date whenever it is rendered

**g)** Set the output format to create a pdf (either `pdf` or `typst`)


## Question Two (to be done after class)

**a)** Read in at least one data file you intend to use for your final project

```{r}
#| label: 2a


```

> Bonus: Caption and number it using Quarto's automatic system

```{r}
#| label: 2b


```

**c)**  Choose a categorical variable in your dataset, get the counts and percentages in each category (a Data Viz I throwback), and turn that into a nicely formatted `kable()`

> Bonus: Caption and number it using Quarto's automatic system

```{r}

```

**d)** Find an article that you think might be relavent to your final project, save it using Zotero, and then cite it using Quarto's Zotero integration
