Use the `hsls_small.dta` data set (the version used in this class) make plots that help answer each of the following questions

- Throughout, you **should** account for missing values by dropping them
- Do not worry about axis labels or other visual elements, that is covered next week

> Hint: You're going to need the [code book](https://nces.ed.gov/datalab/onlinecodebook) to identify the necessary variables

Also note, your final project proposals are due this week as well
